# Cracking the Coding Interview - 6th Edition
## Solution Progress (5 / 189)

This repository is for my solution(s) to each of the 189 problem sets in Cracking the Coding Interview - 6th Edition.
I time myself, make specific notes of any hints used, track my thoughts before/after looking at the solution(s) in the book and leave all solution(s) I attempted, good or bad. I do not "pre-look" at the question(s) and ruminate on them for days while I think of a perfect solution. It's all done in one sitting except where specifically noted. An example of a "two day" solution being one where my car was getting towed and I had to leave in the middle. Check the commit log... funny stuff. =)

The method names generally follow the format of: firstPass() secondPass() thirdPass() forthPass()... with each succussive method being  either something I consider better, or accounts for some additional critera requested by the problem set in the book. I also label them this way so I don't have to dig through commit history on individual files to track changes. Plus, since I am timing myself on these solutions, I want to limit any "non coding" interactions.

I want this repo to serve as a place for me to practice/perfect/reflect/learn/etc. If I am applying for a job and you are looking at this as part of that process, feel free to dig in. I label all the questions as they appear in the 6th edition, so if you have it, you can follow along. It will give you a general idea of my skill set and thought process. 

Enjoy this snapshot of how long it would take me to take solve an compsci whiteboarding question, and if I would have needed a hint to solve it.
